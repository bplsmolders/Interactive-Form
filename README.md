This project validates a form in multiple ways:
- checks if the nameinput is not empty. Delivers error message when it isn't.

- checks if emailInput is not empty. Here a conditional method is added.
+ or error message = 'email input cannot be blank' 'Email address must be formatted correctly'
+ error messages are delivered real-time

- checks if there is at least 1 activity checked of. Delivers error message when there isn't.
+ Disables activities where the time and date are overlapping.

- When creditcard option is chosing as payment option:
  checks if creditcard number, zip code, and cvv code are filled in correctly.
  Delivers individual error message when there isn't.

+ (these are the extra functions, necessary to achieve "exceeds" expectations)
